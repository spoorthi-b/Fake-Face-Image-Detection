The emergence of social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram, led to a huge increase in the volume of image data generated in the last decade. Use of image (and video) processing software’s like Adobe photoshop and DeepFake to create doctored images and videos is a major concern for internet companies like Facebook. These images are prime sources of fake news and are often used in malevolent ways such as for mob incitement.
Currently, a fake image detector is of at most concern to a lot of countries. So, we propose a deep learning framework which differentiates fabricated parts of the image from the real image using supervised learning strategies. We propose a modified neural network structure called the Fake Feature Network which consists of advanced convolution networks. The application also uses a two-step learning method that combines a modified neural structure based on pairwise learning strategy and classifier learning to obtain an effective model for the fake image detection. To enhance the performance of the proposed method, we introduce contrastive loss to learn the common fake features using pairwise learning, which is achieved by incorporating Siamese neural network.


Problem Definition:

In this technological era, social media has become an integral part of our lives. Over the years we have seen social media take different forms than it was created for. One of the problematic forms of social media is spreading fake information and misinformation. People started using social media as a tool to spread fake information to exploit others or damage their reputation. One of the main ways of doing this was creating fake images or videos. The major contributors of creating fake images are Generative Adversarial Networks aka GANs.
GANs are deep learning based generative models that have been widely used to create partial or whole realistic images or videos. These neural networks have been progressing every year creating more sophisticated networks like BigGAN, CycleGAN and PGGAN, which create highly realistic images. They also have the capability to create synthesized speech videos, which was used in the past to sabotage several politician’s credibility.
Current forensic techniques require an expert to analyze the integrity of an image. Since the fake images created are highly sophisticated and almost impossible to detect a system is needed which is on par to the latest GANs models to detect them. A model using customized advanced neural networks to determine fake images has been implemented. A modified neural network structure called Fake Feature Network (FFN) has been proposed, which consists of Convolution Neural Networks, DenseNETs and Siamese Neural Networks. The model created will be trained using pairwise learning strategy to obtain an efficient model.


Methodologies:

The motivation behind creating this network was to implement discriminative feature learning which results in better learning and extraction of fake features in an image. Since the traditional CNNs are not designed to learn discriminative features, integrating the Siamese network with any advanced CNNs has been proposed in developing FFN. Any of the advanced CNNs available today like DenseNet, ResNet, Inception Network,etc., can be used to learn fake features from the training set. For this model DenseNets have been used as the backbone. The resulting FFN is a two streamed network which is designed to allow a pair of input images to facilitate discriminative feature learning.
The major drawback of traditional supervised learning is that it is hard to identify the subject that is excluded from the training phase. Contrastive loss has been integrated to learn the common fake features by pairwise learning. Contrastive loss is incorporated into the energy function of general loss function used in supervised learning techniques. For classification of the image received from FFN one can use any classification technique here.
